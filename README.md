### Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Aaron and I'm a web developer.

And have been for quite some time. My current specialties are Elixir, Ruby and Crystal, and my data stores of choice are MySQL, InfluxDB and Neo4J. Tried to get into mobile development many times in many different ways, but I think it's just not my thing. Fluent in JS, but very concerned about exposing an app with 237467286374 dependencies to the internet.

I've written a lot of different things in this life for a lot of different people, but the recurring themes have been content management and scheduling systems.

I'm pretty good at hosting the things I build. My current stack of choice is Caddy + Passenger. I use Docker plenty in dev and test, but I still avoid it in production.

Someday, I would like to make a living via open source development, or baseball. Maybe both.

My most visible active project is [MyKBO Stats](https://mykbostats.com/) (but sadly I am unable to open source it at this time). It was originally Ruby+Rails (and some parts still are) but is primarily Elixir+Phoenix now.

Seoul is my home, having lived here for over 10 years now, but prior to that I lived in Honolulu for most of my life.
